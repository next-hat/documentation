</p>

<h2>daemon installation</h2> 

1.  Install rustlang

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

2.  Clone the repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nxthat/nanocld 
    cd nanocld
    ```

3.  Install Ubuntu dependencies, you might need to install gcc first

    ```sh
    sudo apt install gcc
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo sh ./scripts/ubuntu.deps.sh
    ```

    For other linux distros refer to the package name and install it with the
    correct package manager / name, in addition if you can make a PR to update the doc it
    would be great! You can see what package is needed by looking in the script


4.  Afterwards install rust dependencies
   
    ```sh
    sh ./scripts/rust.deps.sh
    ```

5.  Finally you can build from the source

    ```sh
    sh ./scripts/release_nanocld.sh
    ```

    You will find a .deb package inside `target/debian` folder or release binary in
    `target/release` folder.
    
<h2>cli installation</h2>

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nxthat/nanocl
    cd nanocl
    ```
2.  Run the build script
    ```sh
    sh ./scripts/release_nanocl.sh
    ```
    You will find a .deb package inside `target/debian` folder or release binary in
    `target/release` folder.
