import Terminal from './terminal';

## Quick install

<Terminal language="sh" filename="sh">
  {`curl -fsSL https://download.next-hat.com/scripts/get-nanocl.sh | sh`}
</Terminal>

This script will download and install the latest version of Nanocl for your platform.
It doesn't require root privileges. Since it install it in your home directory,
under the `~/.nanocl` directory. And add a `~/.nanocl/env` file in your shell profile to
have the `nanocl` command in your `PATH`. But then the command will only be available for your user.

:::info
The script will fallback to build from source from crates.io if no prebuilt
binary is available for your platform. Therefore no man pages will be installed in this case.
