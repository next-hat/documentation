Containerization is a popular technique used in software development and deployment that involves packaging an application and its dependencies into a single, lightweight container. This container can then be deployed on any machine that supports the containerization technology, such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [Nanocl](https://docs.next-hat.com/guides/nanocl), without the need to install the application or its dependencies separately.

Containerization provides several benefits, including increased portability, improved scalability, and simplified deployment and management. By isolating an application and its dependencies within a container, containerization also enhances security and reduces the risk of conflicts between different software components.

As containerization continues to gain popularity, it has become an essential tool for modern software development and deployment. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or IT manager, understanding the basics of containerization can help you stay ahead of the curve and improve the efficiency and reliability of your applications.

## Project Structure

Before we get started, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your system.<br/>
There are multiple ways to install Docker, so we won't cover it here.

Assuming you're using a mono repository, you can host your files on GitHub or any other code hosting platform.<br/>
For this guide, we'll use the following project structure:

```sh
my_project/
├── my-app/     # Frontend app
└── my-api/     # API
```

I'll be hosting the file for this guide on [github](https://github.com/leon3s/infrastruture_example).<br/>
So if you already know how to build container image you can skip this part and just clone the repository to follow the next steps.

To get started, create a main folder for your project and navigate to it:
```
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

Using this project structure, we can separate our frontend and backend services and develop them independently. This approach can simplify development, testing, and deployment and can improve the overall scalability and maintainability of your application.

So, let's create our project structure and start building our frontend and backend services!

## Setting up a Simple Frontend

To set up our frontend app, we'll start by using a simple [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev) template.<br />
However, we recommend using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) if you're planning to use React.

If you're using a different framework, you'll need to build your frontend into a static directory.

By using a tool like Next.js or Vite, you can simplify your frontend development process and improve the performance and scalability of your application. These tools provide advanced features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and more, making it easier to build high-quality, modern web applications.

So, let's set up a simple frontend for our application and start building!

### Creating the Project

Let's create a directory for our frontend application called my-app using the following commands:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm run build
```

This will build a simple frontend app inside the `my-app/build` folder.<br/>
You'll see a message from create-react-app that says:
```console
The build folder is ready to be deployed.
You may serve it with a static server:

  npm install -g serve
  serve -s build
```

Serving your frontend using a node server such as `serve` is not recommended due to poor performance.<br />
Instead, we'll use a nginx container to serve our frontend.

### Create your container image

To create the `Dockerfile` for our application, navigate to the `my-app` directory and create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```docker
# stage 1 - Build our application
# From the latest nodejs lts version
FROM node:18.14.2-alpine AS BUILDER

# Create our app folder
RUN mkdir /app
# Set is as cwd
WORKDIR /app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+) doing this will cache this action untill package.json or package-lock.json is modified
COPY --chown=node package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source code
COPY --chown=node . .
RUN npm run build

# stage 2 - Create app image
# From latest nginx version on alpine to have a small image
FROM nginx:1.23.3-alpine

# Copy our build directory
COPY --from=BUILDER /app/build /app

# Copy our default nginx config
COPY ./server.nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

Before building the image, create the `my-app/server.nginx` file with the following content:

```nginx
server {
  listen       80;
  listen  [::]:80;

  ## Auto index file in /app
  autoindex on;
  root /app;
  try_files $uri/index.html $uri.html $uri/ $uri =404;
  error_page 404 /404.html;

  ## Enable gzip compression
  gzip on;
  gzip_vary on;
  gzip_proxied any;
  gzip_comp_level 6;
  gzip_types image/webp image/png text/html text/plain text/css text/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript application/javascript application/xml font/eot font/otf font/ttf;

  ## Disable gzip for internet explorer compatibility..
  gzip_disable "MSIE [1-6]\.";

  ## Cache all static files
  location ~* ^.+\.(?:css|cur|js|jpe?g|gif|htc|ico|png|html|xml|otf|ttf|eot|woff|woff2|svg)$ {
    access_log off;
    expires 30d;
    add_header Cache-Control public;

    ## No need to bleed constant updates. Send the all shebang in one fell swoop.
    tcp_nodelay off;

    ## Set the OS file cache.
    open_file_cache max=3000 inactive=120s;
    open_file_cache_valid 45s;
    open_file_cache_min_uses 2;
    open_file_cache_errors off;
  }
}
```
This nginx configuration will serve the static files from our frontend for any request it handles. 

Note that we will add a `.dockerignore` file in the `my-app` directory to ignore the `node_modules` and `build` directories during the build process. Here's the content of `my-app/.dockerignore`:
```
node_modules
build
```

This will speed up the build process.

Once the `server.nginx` and `.dockerignore` files are created, you can build the Docker image with the following command:

```
docker build -t my-frontend:0.0.1 -f ./Dockerfile .
```

You can notice few docker flags being used:
  - `build`: To build our image
  - `-t`: To set the tag of our image it's usually like this image_name:version
  - `my-frontend:0.0.1`: Is the tag i choose for the image for this guide.
  - `-f`: Set the path of the Dockerfile
  - `./Dockerfile`: The Dockerfile used to create our image
  - `.`: The context used for the build

### Test your container image

To test our frontend image, run the following command:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:80 my-frontend:0.0.1
```

This will start a container and map port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container.<br/>
Next, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the React app.

You should see the React app page, as shown in the image below:

## Setup a simple API

In this guide, we'll be setting up a simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) project using [Express](https://expressjs.com).

### Create the project

Let's create the  `my-api` directory:

```sh
mkdir my_project/my-api
cd my-api
npm init
npm install --save express
```

Now, let's create our API entry point in `./main.js`:

```js
const express = require('express');

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const HOST = process.env.HOST || '127.0.0.1';

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello World' });
});

app.listen(PORT, HOST, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

We can test it by running:

```sh
node main.js
```

### Create your container image

Now that we have a simple API, we can create its container image.<br/>
Here's a `Dockerfile`:

```docker
# From the latest nodejs lts version
FROM node:18.14.2-alpine

# Create our app folder
RUN mkdir /app
# Set is as cwd
WORKDIR /app

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+) doing this will cache this action untill package.json or package-lock.json is modified
COPY --chown=node package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

COPY . .

# Set host to 0.0.0.0 to bind on all container network interfaces
# This is usefull because we will create a docker network and bind the container to it
ENV HOST=0.0.0.0
# Set the port of the our app to 80 (default http port)
ENV PORT=80
# Expose the port so we can see it during inspection
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["node", "main.js"]
```

Dont forget the `.dockerignore`:

```
node_modules
```

Now we can build our image:

```sh
docker build -t my-api:0.0.1 -f ./Dockerfile .
```

### Test your container image

Now let's test our api container image:
```
docker run -it --name my-api --rm -p 8081:80 my-api:0.0.1
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to see the JSON message:

You should our json message:

<img src="/img/nodejs-express-deploy.png" />

Congratulations! You've containerized your applications.<br />
Now it's time to deploy them on your VPS!
