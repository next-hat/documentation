## Description

Depending on your Nanocl system configuration, you may be required to preface each `nanocl` command with `sudo`. <br />
To avoid having to use `sudo` with the `nanocl` command, your system administrator can create a Unix group called `nanocl` and add users to it.
For more information about installing Nanocl or `sudo` configuration, refer to the [installation](/docs/setups/nanocl/linux/ubuntu.md) instructions for your operating system.
